Commands for TypeScript
============================
npm install -g typescript =>To install typescript globally

tsc --version => To get the version of typescript


TypeScript
--------------
TypeScript is a typed superset of javascript that compiles to plain javascript
ie. Basically the code written in Typescript is complied to javascript using a 
transpiler(converts one language code to another language) in typescript its 
TSC(Typescript Compiler)

Advantages of Typescripts :
----------------------------
1. It gives feeling of code similar to object oriented languages like C#,Java
so the developers coming from that background fells comfortable in writing 
typescript code compared to javascript code

2. We can use classes , interfaces , access modifiers etc. similar to that of
c# and java

3.Designed to be used in developmnet of large application

4.Typescript uses static type checking
5. Class based objects
6. Its modular
7.We can use ES6 in Typescript
8.No Prototypes
9.Inheritance
10.Acess modifiers


Disadvantages of Typescripts :
------------------------------
1.All the code of Typescript is converted to Javascript equivelant but 
we can not trace all code define in typescript to javascript
Eg:

Interface ICustomer {
	addCusttomer();
}


Now the above defined interface cannot be traced in transpiled javascript code
because there is not such thing in javascript

class Customer{
	protected string CustomerName;
	private string CustomerCode;
}

class GoldCustomer extends Customer{
	setCustomerName(){
		CustomerName="Raj";
	}
	
}

Now in above example the protected and private variable of customer class will be defined
as a public member of customer class in javascript equivalent code



So bacically what we see in typescript we dont get it in javascript


Module Loading in Typescript
------------------------------------
In Enterprise project we can create different modules and as per requirement 
we can import those modules by using import and export keywords

//Using export keyword to export these modules
export class Address {
    public Address: string;
}

//For importing address module in customer class
import { Address } from "./Address"; 

//Consuming Address module
class Customer implements ICustomer {
	public addressObj: Address = new Address();
}
Basically typescript uses export pattern we to perform module loading , so basically
its  on demand loading and for that it need to use module loader 

Further, We need a module loader like system.js , webpack ,require js 


Types in Typescript
=========================
String ,Number ,Boolean ,Array
Any ,Void ,Null ,Tuple ,Enum ,Generics
